// If a form exists with a table, the table should be wholely nested inside the form.

// A <th> element should exist for every row of a table grid, including the delete column at the end if it exists.

// Form groups should be separated by a space. This aides the clarity of seeing and making changes to individual groups
// especially if the label has been placed outside the group for multi-item lines
