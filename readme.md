# Egret

Egret is a light-weight inventory system built using .Net Core MVC. 
It currently uses a PostgreSQL database but has largely been designed to significantly reduce the effort required to use a different database. Egret offers user logins, administrator settings, 
and funtionality for managing inventory items, customers, and stock maintenance.

Egret is currently in development.
